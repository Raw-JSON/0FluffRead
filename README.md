## ✨ Features

* **Pure Content:** Strips away advertisements and extraneous tracking code.
* **CORS Bypass:** Utilizes an external proxy (`rss2json.com`) to handle cross-origin resource sharing, making any valid RSS URL loadable client-side.
* **Minimal Footprint:** Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and a utility-first CSS framework (Tailwind CSS CDN).
* **Robust Fetching:** Includes an exponential backoff retry mechanism for reliable feed loading.

## 🏛️ Architecture

The entire stack is designed for speed and simplicity:

* **HTML:** The structure, utilizing semantic elements.
* **JavaScript (`script.js`):** The functional core, handling DOM manipulation, API fetching, and the exponential backoff logic.
* **CSS (`style.css` + Tailwind CDN):** Purely for visual presentation and layout. No complex CSS pre-processors or frameworks.
* **RSS to JSON Proxy:** The API is leveraged to turn the raw XML data from an RSS feed into structured, usable JSON objects, which simplifies the JavaScript parsing logic.
